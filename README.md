# AS5600_Magnetic_encoder-test
AS5600 Library and Sketch to replace an electromechanical rotary encoder
The "STL 6006 Bearing" folder contains the Stl files to make the support and knobs for the axial magnet diam 4mm x 8mm and for the radial magnet supplied with the module.  
Library link: Sub-module "Seeed_Arduino_AS5600 @ 40f4391" 
sketch that increases a variable Var by means of the AS5600 magnetic encoder, with the possibility of varying the incremental step and the variation threshold, making the knob more or less sensitive
